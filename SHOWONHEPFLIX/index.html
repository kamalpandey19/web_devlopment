    <h2>   Reviews:</h2><p>    First of all I think this movie is a game changer for Bollywood with respect to the outstanding VFX ,
    background score and sound effects!!!! Going forward I would honestly say people should go watch this movie atleast once and it 
    truly deserves that. The boycott trend and other topics are really going overboard and not doing any justice to the moviegoers who 
    enjoy good cinema! This movie has its fair concerns for example the lack of chemistry between the pair,the cheesy dialogues or some
     unnecessary stretched scenes 
    
    

    Inspite of these the movie scores above that with its plot,the outline laid for the Astraverse and the beginning of a brilliant
     Trilogy to unfold. Ranbir Kapoor ,Amitabh Bachchan and Nagarjuna have effectively played their parts in defining the story while 
     Mouni Roy is fascinating in her role as Antagonist and definitely a stronger role then Aalia Bhatt who is almost like a prop in 
     the movie who mouths cheesy dialogues 
    Lastly this movie is recommended for its story of the Astraverse and outstanding effects visual and sound both!!!!</p>

       <h2>   Reviews:</h2><p>          One movie, a lot of housefull shows in the theater, full of noises, cheers and applauses, a 
        scenario that celebrates a kannada movie all over Kerala. Today after the morning 11am house full show, I got the best theater
         experience of my life. A view that celebrates a movie by the whole generation without the language barriers.

        KGF : Today, it is a brand. A brand that no one in Indian cinema history can break.üôåüèª
        
        When it comes to cinema, every aspect of this movie is  awesome. Acting, Vfx, Editing, Music, Action, Direction, Story,
         Screenplay, Performances, all are mindblowing to each other. When 'Yash' scored with the character of 'Rocky Bhai', the 
         character came to mind in such a way that we could not even imagine anyone other than him. Sanjay Dutt's 'Adheera', Raveena
          Tandon's 'Ramika Sen' and Srinidhi Shetty's 'Reena' deserve applause. But the most favourite character was Rocky's Mother (
             Shanthama) played by 'Archana Jois'.üëå
        All the songs and their placement was lit. Especially 'Thoofan', the song itself gavs goosebumps. All the characters who was
         given enough space and delivers good performances. The children and their Mass scenes are enough to make the entire crowd to
          whistle for.

       <h2>   Reviews:</h2><p>         This is one of the greatest movies in Film History. I only give 5/5 stars for exceptional
        acting, editing, effects, and CGI. I really enjoyed the movie and I really appreciate  DVV entertainments for producing this
        movie along with crew, Ram Charan, NTR Jr., Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, and Ray Steven. Ram Charan played Alluri
        Seeta Rama Raju very well and I really enjoyed how they creatively made a story on how he revolted against the Tyrannical
        British. I really loved NTR as Bheem and how they incorporated lots of historical facts about how he was part of the Gond
        Tribe  and part of the Komura Clan which was well incorporated. I also loved the contrast between him being a revolutionary
        and a tribal and that made his character come alive. Then, there is Ajay Devgan. His acting alone is amazing and his 
        character brought it to life. I loved the fierceness in his eyes, his bravery, and the vastness of his heart. Devgan ad
        Rama Raju's father was very good and it fit very well. Alia Bhatt and Olivia Morris also did very well. Alia's position
        in the movie didn't feel natural because she is a Bollywood heroine and not a Tollywood heroine so it was kind of weird
        for her to be in the role of Seeta but I feel that she did her best to adapt. Finally, Olivia Morris, did a beautiful 
        job as an English actress, she did an exceptional job which I appreciated very much. I thank Rajamouli for making this 
        film and I loved the movie overall. The dances were very much in sync, the acting was realistic, the effects were 
        gorgeous and so there was nothing that was missing. This is why I gave a 5/5 and I hope to see more movies of this
        nature and creativity from Rajamouli.</p>
